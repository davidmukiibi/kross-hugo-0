I strive to always share what I learn and as such I contribute to the Andela way publication on Medium.com as well as my own page on medium.com. I hold a Bachelors Degree in Computer Applications from Osmania University. With 5+ years of experience in software development.

I have worked with Python (Django and Flask) applications using PostgreSQL as the Database and ReactJS as the consuming client. Furthermore, I have migrated Ruby-on-Rails, ReactJS and NodeJS applications from Heroku (PaaS) to Google Compute Engine (IaaS) and Amazon Web Services with multi-cloud hosting while implementing the same fluidity and efficiency of a PaaS with zero downtime and a 3 minute Blue Green deployment window on VMs.

My cloud experience spans GCP, AWS, Heroku, with both VMs and containers technologies. The building blocks of my Mj√∂lnir include Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Docker, CircleCI, Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Google Stackdriver, Cloudwatch, New Relic, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Google Cloud build and Datadog.

And last but certainly not least, the languages I speak include: Python, Go, Bash.
